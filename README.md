# Overview
Uni Directional Data Flow (UDF) architectural pattern is proving to be an attractive alternative to traditional MVC and MVVM patterns. There are several reasons for this, few are listed below.
1. Better separation of concerns
2. Having a single source of truth for the application
3. Managed way of mutating the application state
4. Managed way of handling side effects
5. Making Views (UI) independent from the application logic and from each other
6. High level of testability 

ReKotlin provide a real good base library for us to create our native Android mobile apps using the UDF pattern. However, there are some initial setup work (both code and configuration) that might be challenging. Android UDF Boilerplate is an attempt to provide Android developers with a clean and easy to use boilerplate project which they can use as a starting point to develop their products.

# What does Android Boilerplate Project Provide
* Abstraction from the ReKotlin initial setup code and configuration which you donâ€™t have to worry about
* Provide a better way for Activities to interact with the application state
* Provide a repeatable methodology of implementing features which will help the developers to worry less about implementation and more about business domain
* High focus on test first

For people who are developing both Android and Android apps,we have the sister boilerplate for IOS which you can take look here. Both boilerplates follow the same patterns to help developers who develop for both platforms to have a uniform understanding of how things work.
